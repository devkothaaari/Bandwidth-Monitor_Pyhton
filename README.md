# Bandwidth-Monitor_Python
Bandwith Monitor in Python using Tkinter _ Computer Networks Mini Project

In the world of computer networks, the efficient utilization of available bandwidth is of high importance. The "Bandwidth Monitor" is a Python-based project that aims to provide network administrators and users with a powerful tool to comprehensively track and manage network bandwidth.
Python has been used to create this project. Key project objectives include real-time monitoring, data visualization, and alert mechanisms to ensure efficient network resource allocation.
The Bandwidth Monitor project employs Python libraries such as psutil(process and system utilities), tkinter and time. Psutil has been used for retrieving information on running processes and system utilization (CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors), system monitoring, profiling, limiting process resources, and managing running processes. Tkinter is a Python module that provides a standard GUI interface to the Tk toolkit. Tk is an open-source cross-platform widget toolkit that is used to create graphical user interfaces.
This abstract gives a glimpse of Bandwidth Monitor project's capabilities, with the potential to significantly enhance network management, a useful tool for network administrators, businesses, and individuals seeking to monitor and manage their network bandwidth effectively.
